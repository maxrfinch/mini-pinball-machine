# Mini Pinball Machine
A mini pinball machine formerly based on the Raspberry Pi 4 + Arduino Uno, now based on the Raspberry Pi 5 + Pico.
The game contains several powerups, high scores, and is optimized to run at 60fps.

This Fork is updated to include:
- Ported Chipmunk physics -> Box2D for more reliable gameplay in 2025+
- 3D Print Files
- 3D Laser Cut Files *or* SendCutSend order links
- Full Build Instructions

Optional:
- This build includes the ability to add up to 65 NEOPIXEL RGB leds for light effects + haptic motors
- This build includes the ability to add LED arcade buttons
- This build includes the ability to add a camera for high score pictures (one of my favorite features of the Elton John pinball machine)
